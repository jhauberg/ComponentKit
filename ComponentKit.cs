/// ###What it is
/// 
/// **ComponentKit** provides a set of **C#** interfaces and classes that are useful when you need to maintain an **in-memory database** of **entity** composites.
/// 
/// Features include: **triggers**, for handling the processing of components, **dependency injection**, and some very basic **inter-component messaging**.
/// 
/// Though originally intended as an educational reference/example on how to implement *yet another entity system*, it should be perfectly fine for use in real productions too.
/// 
/// Further **documentation** can be found through the button at the upper-right corner of this page. All documentation has been generated straight from the source, using [Nocco](http://dontangg.github.com/nocco/).
///
