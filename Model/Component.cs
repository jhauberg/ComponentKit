/// ###TL;DR..
/// 
/// The `Component` is sub-classed to build custom behavior.
/// 
/// ####Processing
/// 
/// Triggers can be used to intercept when components are attached/dettached from entities, 
/// which makes it easy to add special processing for specific types of components.
/// 
/// ####Staying n'sync
/// 
/// A component becomes out-of-sync when it is no longer attached to an `IEntityRecord`. Triggers, however, 
/// are not guaranteed to be notified of this immediately. For example, the default implementation of 
/// `IEntityRecordCollection` only execute triggers during sync operations.
